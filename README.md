# Intro ┆⏔⏔⏔ ꒰ ᧔ෆ᧓ ꒱ ⏔⏔⏔┆
Hello! I'm Alexander ( I also go by Char )

I'm aroace and transmasc genderfluid ( he/they ) 
 
I am a minor, so I do ask that you don't be **too** sexual around me, it makes me uncomfortable.

I avidly read, draw, and write! I also participate in a lot of fandom spaces, the most prominent being AMREV and CRK. 

(currently fixated on AMREV/Historical Lams)

# Ponytown ┆⏔⏔⏔ ꒰ ᧔ෆ᧓ ꒱ ⏔⏔⏔┆

I've been on Ponytown for 3 years going on 4 (not that long in retrospect lmao)

As of right now, I do not come online often just because Ponytown is not that prominent in my everyday anymore, but I still do love making friends.

you may interact **unless stated otherwise.**

C+H are okay but **do not** be offended if I move away from you, it's likely nothing personal.
