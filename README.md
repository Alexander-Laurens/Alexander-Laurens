**DNI:**

basic criteria, darkshippers, 20+, etc. 

other than that, you're free to talk to me!

**Boundaries:**

I am a minor, so I do ask that you don't be **too** sexual around me, it makes me uncomfortable.

Furthermore, don't be a dick for no reason, especially if I don't know you like that. It's just odd.

# Ponytown ┆⏔⏔⏔ ꒰ ᧔ෆ᧓ ꒱ ⏔⏔⏔┆

I've been on Ponytown for 3 years going on 4 (not that long in retrospect lmao)

As of right now, I do not come online often just because Ponytown is not that prominent in my everyday anymore, but I still do love making friends on there.


you may interact **unless stated otherwise.**

C+H are okay but **do not** be offended if I move away from you, it's likely nothing personal.

If I don't respond, I'm probably offtab, so whisper me.

Usually at docks, old (2022) FNAF area, café, or Epic: the Musical area.
